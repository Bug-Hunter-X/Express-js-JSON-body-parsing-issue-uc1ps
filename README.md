# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON body parsing in Express.js applications.

## Bug Description
The Express.js application fails to parse the JSON body of a POST request if the `Content-Type` header is missing or incorrect. This results in `req.body` being empty, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with a JSON payload in the request body, ensuring the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`.  Observe that it works as expected.
5. Now, send another POST request without the `Content-Type` header, or with an incorrect header like `Content-Type: text/plain`.  Observe that it will fail and req.body will be empty.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `Content-Type` header is correctly set when sending POST requests. However, Express.js offers a more robust solution:

1. Modify the server to parse JSON even when Content-Type header is missing or incorrect.
2. This is done by using the `express.json()` middleware before using other middleware for the given endpoint.

## Solution Details
The solution code ensures proper JSON parsing regardless of the `Content-Type` header. It's important to note that relying solely on this solution is not a best practice; proper header management on the client side remains crucial.
